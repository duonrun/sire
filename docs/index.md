# Sire Validation Library

Sire is a PHP validation library that lets you define schemas with a compact
rule DSL, validate arbitrary input, and consume a typed validation result.

> **Note:** This is a preview feature currently under active development.

## Documentation sections

Start with the section that matches your current task. Each section focuses on
one workflow so you can move from install to production usage quickly.

- [Installation](installation.md)
- [Usage](usage.md)
- [Development](development.md)

## Core concepts

Sire uses a schema object that defines fields, field types, and validators. A
validation run returns a `ValidationResult` object with typed violations,
structured error output, and both cast and pristine values.

- Define fields with `Schema::add()`.
- Describe constraints with the string DSL, for example `required` or
  `min:10`.
- Call `Schema::validate()` to get a `ValidationResult`.
- Read `isValid()`, `violations()`, `errors()`, `values()`, and
  `pristineValues()` on the result.

## Next steps

If you are new to the library, continue with the installation guide first.
