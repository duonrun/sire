# Installation

This guide shows how to install Sire in an application and how to set up a
local checkout for library development.

## Requirements

Before you install Sire, make sure your environment matches the supported
runtime and tooling versions.

- PHP `^8.5`
- Composer

## Install in an application

Use Composer to add Sire as a project dependency.

1. Run the dependency install command.

   ```bash
   composer require duon/sire
   ```

2. Ensure your Composer autoloader is loaded in your application bootstrap.

3. Create a shape and run a first validation call.

## Install for local development

If you want to contribute to Sire itself, install the repository dependencies
including development tools.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Run the baseline quality checks.

   ```bash
   composer test
   composer types
   ```
